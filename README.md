> An app build with React<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1200px-React-icon.svg.png" width=30px align=top />

This app is made by Marvin Sernee, through a Udemy course to learn React. It is created for educational purposes only and is seen as a personal project for growth as a Front-End Developer. The course is handed by Andrew Mead. The project itself is coded as a challenge and is self-made, though inspired by the videos of the course.
